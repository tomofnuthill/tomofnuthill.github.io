		<h3 align="center">June 2<sup>nd</sup> 2022: Making Silver Azide</h3>
		<h4>Attempt 1</h4>
		<p>After having little luck with making isopropyl nitrite I decided to try a different route for the azide synthesis. This reaction involves making hydrogen azide and is thus very dangerous and can only be done on small scale, but, I already had all the reagents needed; nitric acid, hydrazinium hydrogensulfate, and silver nitrate. The way that this reaction works is the hydrazine reduces some of the nitric acid to nitrous acid and then the nitrous acid diazotizes the hydrazine. This reaciton forms hydrogen azide which is evapourated and bubbled through a silver nitrate solution where it reacts to make silver azide and nitric acid. This silver azide, being insoluble, precipitates and can be collected via filtration. This reaciton isn’t very efficient and generates side products such as nitrous oxide, which is formed when nitrous acid reacts with hydrogen azide. This is actually a blessing is disguise though because this dilutes the stream of very explosive hydrogen azide gas, making it less likely to explode or condense. </p>

		<p>To do the reaction to make the silver azide I started by dissolving 700mg of silver nitrate enough water to fill the second test tube of the apparatus half way. I then placed 1.5g of hydrazinium hydrogensulfate in the first test tube. Next I poured 4ml of azeotropic nitric acid into the first test tube and finished assembling the rest of the apparatus so that the gas generated in the first test tube would be bubbled into the second. I started heating with a heat gun the mixture started bubbling. I tried to keep the rest of the reaction vessel above 40°C, the boiling point of hydrogen azide, as to make sure that it didn’t condense forming very explosive droplets. The reaction quickly ran away and foamed over into the second test tube. This was dangerous. A white precipitate formed in the second test tube and a lot of nitrogen dioxide was formed. 	</p>

		<p>I collected the precipitate but when I tested it it had no explosive properties. It did decompose and it was very photosensitive though. My best guess is that this precipitate was formed when hydrazine reacted with the silver nitrate when the reaction bubbled over.
		</p>
		<h4>Attempt 2</h4>
		<p>For my second attempt I did everything the same as last time except 2 things; I used 3.5ml of azeotropic nitric acid with 0.5ml of water, and I was more gentle with the heating. The reaction took a total of 29 minutes. Throughout the reaction a grey precipitate (probably grey from the silver in the degraded silver nitrate) formed in the second test tube and at the end I filtered it off to collect it. When heated while wet it explodes violently but only after it has fully dried off. I will do more tests with it tomorrow. </p>

		<h3 align="center">October 14<sup>th</sup> 2022: Making Sodium Azide</h3>
		<p>
		Today I made some sodium azide on a 30mmol scale. I made it using a very similar technique to how I’ve made silver azide in the past, using a practically identical hydrogen azide generator. The difference was that instead of bubbling the gas produced through an aqueous silver nitrate solution, I bubbled it through anhydrous ethanolic sodium hydroxide. This way the hydrogen azide would react with the sodium hydroxide to form water and sodium azide (HN<sub>3</sub> + NaOH ---> NaN<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O). The sodium hydroxide would then precipitate out as it has a low solubility in ethanol.</p>
		<p>
		I started by getting safety gear (rain jacket, rain pants, safety goggles, gloves both leather and latex ect.) and then adding 5.86 (45mmol) of hydrazine sulfate to a 2 neck 250ml round bottom boiling flask. A gas adapter was attached to the first neck which had a hose leading to a bike pump. This way I could use air to flush the system and keep the hydrogen azide below it’s explosive limit. To the second neck I attached a gas adapter which went into a hose that bubbled the gas produced through a solution in a graduated cylinder (20ml). I then prepared a solution of 2g of sodium hydroxide in 20ml of anhydrous ethanol. This solution was poured into the graduated cylinder. I then poured 10ml of azeotropic nitric acid mixed with 5ml of water into the round bottom flask and began heating with a heat gun while simultaneously using the bike pump to flush the apparatus with air. Soon bubbles started to form and a precipitate formed in the graduated cylinder. After ~15 minutes all the hydrazine sulfate in the flask was gone and the reaction was complete. I then very carefully filtered the solution in the graduated cylinder and collected the precipitate.
		</p>
		<p>
		After drying the final yield was 190mg or 10%. This is  quite a bit worse than when I did the same thing with silver azide. I think this might be cause the reaction of the hydrogen azide with sodium hydroxide is quite exothermic and i didn’t chill it before filtering so perhaps there was lots of sodium azide dissolved in the ethanol. It could also be due to water in the ethanol. I tested the sodium azide with blow torch and it quickly decomposed with an orange flame, meaning that the product is almost certainly sodium azide.
